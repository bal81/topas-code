# topas-code
The TOol for PArticle Simulation (TOPAS) is a Geant4 wrapper created to facilitate Monte Carlo simulations for users of different backgrounds. Topas documentation can be found at https://topas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This code can be used as a topas extension in order to print physical quantities of interest for each interaction in a txt file for posterior analysis. Any topas extension is built in native Geant4 syntaxis.
